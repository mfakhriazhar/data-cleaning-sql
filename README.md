In today's data-driven era, data quality determines the accuracy of analysis and decision-making. Unfortunately, raw data often contains issues such as missing values, duplication, and inconsistent formatting, which can lead to misleading analysis results. Therefore, this project focuses on the data cleaning process using MySQL to ensure the data used is clean, valid, and ready for analysis. With proper data cleaning, we can minimize the risk of errors and improve the quality of the insights generated.

Goals :  
- Remove duplicate data
- Standardize the data
- Handle NULL values and blank values
- Remove any columns

Insights :  
Following the data cleaning process in MySQL, the dataset has been successfully refined to eliminate duplicate records, address missing values in critical fields, and correct formatting inconsistencies. We have standardized and cleaned essential columns, including total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and date. This enhanced dataset now serves as a solid and reliable foundation for deeper analysis, enabling us to effectively identify layoff trends across various industries, time periods, and regions.

Conclusion :  
- This project really highlights just how vital data cleaning is for achieving high-quality analysis. By using MySQL, we tackled challenges like missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent formats, which helped ensure our data is reliable and accurate.
- With clean data in hand, we can uncover meaningful insights and make thoughtful, informed decisions about global layoff trends. As we move ahead, this dataset is not just ready—it’s set for advanced analysis, including visualization and predictive modeling, which will help us better understand and respond strategically.
